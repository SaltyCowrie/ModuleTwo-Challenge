## Portfolio

A web application designed as a personal portfolio. Links to web apps, as well as, a demonstration for my career as a web developing professional.

Using mainly HTML and CSS, I am formatting the basic structure of what will later be my continuous student portfolio. This portfolio can be where I store my projects and whre I show my skills in style.
